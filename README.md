# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-with-inertia-weights-using-two-alternatives
This is program in python for particle swarm optimization for minimizing ackermann function.
This can also be generalized to minimizing any function.
This program uses inertia weights alternatives.
The two alternatives are Random Adjustments and Linear Decreasing.
